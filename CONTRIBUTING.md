## Docs

The docs for this plugin are in [docs/](docs/) and are published at https://docs.termix.site/plugins/serial. Settings, permissions, services, environment variables and the API reference are made from `manifest.json` and the `@openapi` comments in the code, so keep those up to date instead of writing them by hand. See [writing docs](https://docs.termix.site/develop/docs).
